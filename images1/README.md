# Digital Image Processing
A picture is stored on the computer as a series of numbers -- numbers indicating variations of red, green, and blue at a particular location on a grid of pixels. 

## Pixels
Take a picture and lay a grid of squares over it. Each of the squares is a pixel. To store the picture, the computer records a number to represent the color of each square (sort of like a digital color-by-number). The more squares in the grid, the better the image will look.

A *pixel* (short for *picture element*) is a tiny square of color. Lots of pixels together form an image.
