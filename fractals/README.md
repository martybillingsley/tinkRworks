# Fractals
A *fractal* is a curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. In other words, it looks the same at any magnification. Fractals are useful in modeling structures (such as eroded coastlines or snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth, fluid turbulence, and galaxy formation.

In drawing a fractal on the screen, there must be some point at which the program stops drawing. A Python turtle, after all, can't move forward less than one pixel or turn less than one degree.
